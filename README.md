This is a short horror game for my Interactive Terminal Project

Numbers must be intergers between 1 and 4 when choosing scenario otherwise game will break.

This game makes you analyze a few scenarios then choose one. After you have chosen, you are asked a few questions to correspond and if you answer correctly, you win!
If not, then you lose. It's short and simple.
